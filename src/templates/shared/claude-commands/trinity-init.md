Complete the Trinity Method integration for this project.

**Context:** Users just deployed Trinity Method and the deployment team needs to finish their tasks.

**Process:**
1. Launch Deployment Team to complete Trinity integration:
   - **TAN (Structure)** - Verify and optimize project structure
   - **ZEN (Documentation)** - Complete Trinity documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, ISSUES.md, To-do.md, Technical-Debt.md)
   - **INO (Context)** - Analyze codebase and update context hierarchy

2. After deployment team completes their work:
   - **JUNO (Quality Auditor)** performs comprehensive audit:
     - Trinity documents verification
     - Project structure assessment
     - Integration completeness check
   - JUNO reports findings to user

**Outcome:** Trinity Method fully integrated and audited, ready for first workflow.

**Note:** This command should be run once after initial deployment.
