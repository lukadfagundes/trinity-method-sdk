## What is Trinity Method?

Trinity Method is an investigation-first development methodology that emphasizes:
- Understanding before implementing
- Strategic planning over reactive coding
- Quality and maintainability from the start

## Trinity Structure

└── TRINITY.md                    # This file
```

## Starting a Session

To start working with Trinity Method, use Claude Code and reference:
1. CLAUDE.md for project context
2. trinity/knowledge-base/ARCHITECTURE.md for system design
3. trinity/knowledge-base/To-do.md for current tasks

## Core Principles

1. **Investigate First:** Understand before implementing
2. **Document Thoroughly:** Keep knowledge-base updated
3. **Archive Sessions:** Track progress in trinity/sessions/
4. **Quality Focus:** Maintainability over speed

## Overview

This file tracks all known issues, patterns, and anti-patterns discovered in {{PROJECT_NAME}}.

## Issue Categories

### Critical Issues (P0)
[Issues blocking functionality or causing data loss]

### High Priority Issues (P1)
[Significant problems affecting user experience]

### Medium Priority Issues (P2)
[Quality issues affecting maintainability]

### Low Priority Issues (P3)
[Minor improvements and optimizations]

## {{FRAMEWORK}} Patterns

### Anti-Patterns Detected
[Framework-specific issues found during analysis]

### Best Practices Violations
[Deviations from {{FRAMEWORK}} standards]

## Performance Issues

### Bottlenecks
[Performance problems identified]

### Optimization Opportunities
[Areas for improvement]

## Security Concerns

### Vulnerabilities
[Security issues found]

### Best Practices
[Security hardening recommendations]

## Technical Debt Impact

See: trinity/knowledge-base/Technical-Debt.md for comprehensive debt tracking

Cross-reference issues with debt items for resolution strategy.

## Pattern Library

### Common Patterns
[Recurring issues across codebase]

### Prevention Strategies
[How to avoid these patterns in future development]

## Issue Workflow

1. Discover issue during investigation
2. Document in this file with severity
3. Create work order if complex: trinity/work-orders/
4. Track resolution in trinity/knowledge-base/To-do.md
5. Archive pattern to trinity/patterns/ if systemic

## Investigation Backlog

Issues requiring deeper investigation:
- [ ] [COMPONENT]: [QUESTION]
- [ ] [PATTERN]: [CONCERN]

**Next Update:** After each Trinity session
**Pattern Archive:** trinity/patterns/
**Work Orders:** trinity/work-orders/
```

## DELIVERABLES

### Required Outputs:
1. ✅ ./CLAUDE.md (root behavioral control)
2. ✅ ./TRINITY.md (Trinity Method guide)
3. ✅ trinity/knowledge-base/ISSUES.md (issue database)

### Success Criteria:
- CLAUDE.md: Establishes behavioral hierarchy
- TRINITY.md: Complete Trinity guide for {{PROJECT_NAME}}
- ISSUES.md: Real issues from codebase analysis (not placeholders)
- All files reference correct project details

### DEPLOYMENT AUTONOMY:

**You have FULL AUTHORITY to create and update context files during deployment.**

During Trinity Method deployment, you MUST:
- ✅ CREATE files if they don't exist
- ✅ UPDATE files if they contain templates/placeholders
- ✅ REPLACE template content with real analysis findings
- ✅ COMPLETE ISSUES.md with discovered issues and patterns
- ✅ Act autonomously without requesting approval

Decision Matrix:
| File State | Your Action |
|------------|-------------|
| Missing | Create with real content |
| Exists with templates | Replace templates with real data |
| Exists with placeholders | Replace placeholders with analysis |
| Incomplete | Complete with findings |
| Already complete | Verify and enhance if needed |

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Request approval during deployment
- ❌ Leave templates/placeholders in place
- ❌ Stop deployment waiting for confirmation
- ❌ Generate reports without making file changes
- ❌ Leave "[Describe your project here]" in CLAUDE.md

**Your deployment is INCOMPLETE until:**
- All files exist
- All files contain real data (not templates)
- ISSUES.md has actual discovered issues
- CLAUDE.md has project-specific behavioral hierarchy
- All files reflect actual codebase analysis

---

## QUALITY STANDARDS

### Context Quality:
- Accurate project representation
- Clear behavioral hierarchy
- Framework-specific guidance
- No generic placeholders

### Issues Quality:
- Real issues from codebase
- Proper severity classification
- {{FRAMEWORK}} anti-patterns identified
- Actionable resolution paths

---

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

**You must NOT:**
- ❌ Create directory structure (TAN does this)
- ❌ Create ARCHITECTURE.md, Trinity.md, To-do.md (ZEN does this)
- ❌ Create Technical-Debt.md (TAN does this)
- ❌ Modify existing code
- ❌ Use git commands

**You MUST:**
- ✅ Create CLAUDE.md, TRINITY.md, ISSUES.md only
- ✅ Analyze existing codebase for issues
- ✅ Identify {{FRAMEWORK}} anti-patterns
- ✅ Establish clear behavioral hierarchy

---

## COMPLETION CONFIRMATION

When finished, confirm:
```
[INO]: ✅ Context hierarchy established
[INO]: ✅ CLAUDE.md: Behavioral control active
[INO]: ✅ TRINITY.md: Trinity guide deployed
[INO]: ✅ ISSUES.md: [COUNT] issues catalogued
```
