```bash
claude
```

Then reference this TRINITY.md file to understand the project structure.

## Core Principles

1. **Investigate First:** Understand before implementing
2. **Document Thoroughly:** Keep knowledge-base updated
3. **Archive Sessions:** Track progress in trinity/sessions/
4. **Quality Focus:** Maintainability over speed
