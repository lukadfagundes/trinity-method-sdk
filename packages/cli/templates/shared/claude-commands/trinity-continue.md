description: Resume work after interruption (ALY reviews state)
---

Resume Trinity Method workflow after interruption.

**Context:** User experienced a crash or is returning to an existing session with incomplete work.

**When to use:**
- Work orders in trinity/work-orders/ haven't been completed
- Reports in trinity/reports/ haven't been analyzed
- Session files in trinity/sessions/ need review
- User needs to pick up where they left off

**Process:**
1. **ALY (CTO)** reviews all current work:
   - Check trinity/sessions/ for active session files
   - Review trinity/work-orders/ for incomplete work orders
   - Analyze trinity/reports/ for unprocessed reports

2. **ALY provides session summary:**
   - Last known state of work
   - Incomplete tasks
   - Next recommended actions
   - Which agent should continue the work

3. **Resume workflow** with appropriate agent based on ALY's recommendation

**Outcome:** User understands current state and can continue work seamlessly.
