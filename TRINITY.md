## What is Trinity Method?

Trinity Method is an investigation-first development methodology that emphasizes:
- Understanding before implementing
- Strategic planning over reactive coding
- Quality and maintainability from the start

## Starting a Session

To start working with Trinity Method, use Claude Code:

```bash
claude
```

Then reference this TRINITY.md file to understand the project structure.

## Core Principles

1. **Investigate First:** Understand before implementing
2. **Document Thoroughly:** Keep knowledge-base updated
3. **Archive Sessions:** Track progress in trinity/sessions/
4. **Quality Focus:** Maintainability over speed
