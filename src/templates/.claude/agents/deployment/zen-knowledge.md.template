Location: `trinity/knowledge-base/Trinity.md`

```markdown
# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Trinity Method v2.0

**Version:** {{TRINITY_VERSION}}
**Deployed:** {{DEPLOYMENT_TIMESTAMP}}

## What is Trinity Method v2.0?

Trinity Method is an investigation-first development methodology that emphasizes:
- Understanding before implementing
- Strategic planning over reactive coding
- AI-orchestrated, scale-based workflows (NEW in v2.0)
- Quality and maintainability from the start
- Zero quality regressions via BAS 6-phase gate (NEW in v2.0)

## Trinity v2.0 for {{FRAMEWORK}}

### Scale-Based Workflows

Trinity v2.0 adapts implementation approach based on scope:

| Scale  | File Count | Duration  | Stop Points | Documentation |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Small  | 1-2 files  | ~30 min   | 0          | Inline only   |
| Medium | 3-5 files  | 2-6 hrs   | 2          | Design + Plan |
| Large  | 6+ files   | 1-2 days  | 4          | PRD + ADR + Design + Plan + Tasks |

### {{FRAMEWORK}} Adaptations
- Component Investigation: [APPROACH]
- State Management Strategy: [METHOD]
- Testing Protocol: [FRAMEWORK] with TDD (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Quality Gates: BAS 6-phase validation after every task

### AJ MAESTRO & 11-Agent Team (v2.0)

**Leadership:**
- **ALY** (CTO) - Strategic planning, scale determination
- **AJ MAESTRO** (Orchestrator) - Coordinates 19 specialized agents across 5 teams

**Planning Agents:**
- **MON** - Requirements analysis, scale determination
- **ROR** - Technical design, ADRs
- **TRA** - Work planning with BAS quality gates
- **EUS** - Task decomposition (1 task = 1 commit)

**Execution Agents:**
- **KIL** - Task execution (TDD: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- **BAS** - 6-phase quality gate (linting, structure, build, tests, coverage, review)
- **DRA** - Code review, Design Doc compliance validation

**Support Agents:**
- **APO** - API documentation (JSDoc/TSDoc)
- **BON** - Dependency management, security audits
- **CAP** - Configuration files, environment variables
- **URO** - Code refactoring (tests pass before/after)

### Workflow Customization

**Session Protocol:**
1. ALY determines scale (Small/Medium/Large)
2. Delegate to AJ MAESTRO for orchestration
3. Review stop points for Medium/Large scale (0/2/4 stops)
4. Validate DRA compliance reports
5. Update knowledge base documentation

**Work Order System (Legacy):**
- Investigation orders: trinity/work-orders/
- Work order templates: trinity/templates/work-orders/
- Investigation templates: trinity/templates/investigations/
- Patterns: trinity/patterns/
- *Note: v2.0 uses scale-based workflows, work orders optional*

### Quality Standards (v2.0)

**Code Quality (enforced by BAS Phase 6):**
- Test Coverage: ≥80% (lines and branches)
- {{FRAMEWORK}} Best Practices: Mandatory
- Functions: ≤2 parameters, <200 lines, ≤4 nesting
- Try-catch wraps all async operations
- No code duplication (DRY principle)

**See:** `trinity/knowledge-base/CODING-PRINCIPLES.md`

**Testing Quality (enforced by BAS Phase 4-5):**
- TDD cycle: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR mandatory
- AAA pattern: Arrange-Act-Assert
- Independent tests (no interdependencies)
- Test names descriptive and clear

**See:** `trinity/knowledge-base/TESTING-PRINCIPLES.md`

**AI Development (scale workflows):**
- Small scale: Direct implementation, 0 stops
- Medium scale: Design + tasks, 2 stops
- Large scale: Full planning (PRD + ADR + design + plan + tasks), 4 stops

**See:** `trinity/knowledge-base/AI-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md`

**Documentation Quality:**
- Architecture: Always current
- To-do: Updated each session
- Technical Debt: Tracked and prioritized
- Issues: Catalogued with patterns
- Scale-based requirements

**See:** `trinity/knowledge-base/DOCUMENTATION-CRITERIA.md`

```

## Getting Started with v2.0

1. Review `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system understanding
2. Read `CODING-PRINCIPLES.md` and `TESTING-PRINCIPLES.md` for standards
3. Check `AI-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md` for scale-based workflows
4. Review `To-do.md` for current priorities
5. Consult `ISSUES.md` for known problems
6. Let ALY determine scale, AJ MAESTRO orchestrates implementation
```

### Phase 3: Create To-do.md
