# Trinity Method SDK - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values

# NPM Publishing Token
# Required for: npm publish, CD pipeline automation
#
# IMPORTANT: Create token via web UI (not npm CLI) to avoid permission errors
#
# Step-by-step instructions:
# 1. Log in to npm website: https://www.npmjs.com
#    - Complete browser authentication with 2FA
#    - DO NOT bypass 2FA - keep your account secure
#
# 2. Navigate to: https://www.npmjs.com/settings/<your-username>/tokens
#    - Click "Generate New Token"
#    - Select "Granular Access Token"
#
# 3. Configure token:
#    - Name: "Trinity Method SDK CI/CD"
#    - Expiration: 90 days (maximum allowed by npm)
#    - Packages and scopes: Select "trinity-method-sdk"
#    - Permissions: "Read and write"
#
# 4. Generate and copy token immediately (shown only once)
#
# 5. Add to GitHub Secrets:
#    - Go to: https://github.com/<your-username>/trinity-method-sdk/settings/secrets/actions
#    - Click "New repository secret"
#    - Name: NPM_TOKEN
#    - Value: [paste token here]
#
# 6. For local development (optional):
#    - Copy this file to .env
#    - Paste token value below
#    - Never commit .env to version control
#
# Troubleshooting:
# - If you see "EPERM: operation not permitted" errors with npm login/token CLI
#   → Use the web UI method above instead
# - If token expires (90 days):
#   → Repeat steps 2-5 to generate new token
#   → Update GitHub Secret with new value
# - If authentication fails in CD pipeline:
#   → Verify NPM_TOKEN secret exists in GitHub
#   → Verify token has not expired
#   → Verify token has publish permissions for trinity-method-sdk
#
NPM_TOKEN=

# GitHub Actions Secrets
# These should be configured in GitHub repository settings:
# Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
#
# NPM_TOKEN - Same token as above, for automated publishing in CD pipeline
