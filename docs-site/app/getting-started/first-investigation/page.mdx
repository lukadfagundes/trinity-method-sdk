# Your First Investigation

This guide walks you through creating and completing your first Trinity Method investigation - a security audit of a sample application.

## Overview

You'll learn how to:
1. Create an investigation using the wizard
2. Execute the investigation with AI agents
3. Review findings and metrics
4. Generate reports and documentation

**Time to complete**: ~15 minutes

## Step 1: Create the Investigation

Use the Trinity wizard to create a security audit:

```bash
trinity wizard
```

You'll be prompted with:

```
? What type of investigation would you like to create?
  ❯ Security Audit
    Performance Review
    Architecture Analysis
    Code Quality
    Custom Investigation

? Where is your codebase located? (.)

? Would you like to use smart context detection? (Y/n)
```

Select **Security Audit** and accept the defaults. The wizard will:

- 🔍 Auto-detect your framework (Next.js, React, Express, etc.)
- 🎯 Identify your programming language
- 📋 Generate an investigation plan with 14 security tasks
- ⏱️ Estimate time and resource requirements

## Step 2: Review the Investigation Plan

The wizard creates:

```
trinity/
├── sessions/
│   └── SEC-2025-001/
│       ├── INVESTIGATION.md      # Investigation overview
│       ├── PLAN.md              # Detailed plan
│       └── FINDINGS.md          # Results (empty for now)
```

Open `INVESTIGATION.md` to see your investigation:

```markdown
# Security Audit Investigation

**ID**: SEC-2025-001
**Type**: Security Audit
**Status**: Ready
**Created**: 2025-01-15

## Scope
- Authentication & Authorization
- Input Validation
- XSS Prevention
- CSRF Protection
- Dependency Vulnerabilities
...
```

## Step 3: Run the Investigation

Start the investigation with:

```bash
trinity run SEC-2025-001
```

This launches the AI agents to execute the security audit:

```
🔍 Starting Security Audit Investigation (SEC-2025-001)

[TAN] Analyzing authentication implementation...
[TAN] ✓ Found authentication logic in src/auth/
[JUNO] Auditing authentication for security issues...
[JUNO] ⚠️ Warning: JWT tokens do not expire
[JUNO] ⚠️ Warning: No rate limiting on login endpoint

[TAN] Analyzing input validation...
[TAN] ✓ Found user input handlers
[JUNO] ✓ Input validation present
[JUNO] ⚠️ Warning: SQL injection risk in search query

...

📊 Investigation complete: 3 high, 5 medium, 2 low priority findings
```

## Step 4: Review Findings

Findings are automatically captured in `FINDINGS.md`:

```markdown
# Security Audit Findings

## High Priority

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerability
**Location**: src/api/search.ts:42
**Severity**: High
**Description**: User input directly concatenated into SQL query

**Recommendation**: Use parameterized queries or an ORM
```

## Step 5: View Analytics

Check the performance metrics:

```bash
trinity analytics SEC-2025-001
```

Output:

```
Investigation Metrics (SEC-2025-001)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Duration:           45 minutes
Tasks Completed:    14/14
Tokens Used:        142,500
Cost Estimate:      $0.75

Agent Performance:
  TAN:  8 tasks (avg 4.2 min, 8,500 tokens)
  JUNO: 6 tasks (avg 6.1 min, 15,200 tokens)

Findings:
  High:     3
  Medium:   5
  Low:      2
```

## Step 6: Generate Report

Create a comprehensive report:

```bash
trinity report SEC-2025-001 --format markdown
```

This generates `trinity/sessions/SEC-2025-001/REPORT.md` with:

- Executive summary
- Detailed findings with code examples
- Risk assessment
- Remediation recommendations
- Metrics and analytics

## Step 7: Fix Issues (Optional)

Use the findings to create work orders:

```bash
trinity workorder from-finding SEC-2025-001 --finding-id F001
```

This creates a work order to fix the SQL injection vulnerability:

```markdown
# Work Order: Fix SQL Injection in Search

**From**: SEC-2025-001, Finding F001
**Priority**: High
**Assigned**: Developer

## Task
Replace string concatenation with parameterized query in search endpoint

## Location
src/api/search.ts:42
...
```

## What You've Learned

✅ Created an investigation using the wizard
✅ Executed automated security analysis with AI agents
✅ Reviewed findings and metrics
✅ Generated professional reports
✅ Created actionable work orders

## Next Steps

- [Run a Performance Review](/guides/performance) - Optimize your application
- [Architecture Analysis](/guides/architecture) - Document your system
- [Agent Reference](/agents) - Learn about each AI agent's capabilities
- [API Documentation](/api) - Explore the full Trinity API

## Common Issues

### "Investigation not found"

Make sure you're in the project root directory where `trinity/` exists.

### "No findings captured"

Check that your AI provider (Claude, Copilot) is properly configured in your IDE.

### "Permission denied"

Run `chmod +x $(which trinity)` to make the CLI executable.

## Advanced Options

### Custom Investigation Scope

```bash
trinity create investigation \
  --type security-audit \
  --scope "src/api/**/*.ts" \
  --exclude "**/*.test.ts"
```

### Specific Focus Areas

```bash
trinity wizard --focus authentication,authorization,input-validation
```

### Using Saved Preferences

```bash
trinity wizard --profile my-security-profile
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small** - Focus on one module or feature first
2. **Review Context** - Ensure agents have access to relevant code
3. **Iterate** - Investigations can be re-run with refined scope
4. **Document** - Keep session notes in `INVESTIGATION.md`
5. **Track Progress** - Use metrics to measure improvement over time
