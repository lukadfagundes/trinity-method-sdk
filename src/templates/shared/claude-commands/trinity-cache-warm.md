description: Pre-populate cache with frequently used patterns
---

Warm up the Trinity Method cache system with frequently used patterns and data.

**Cache Warming Strategy:**

1. **Investigation Templates**
   - All investigation templates
   - Common investigation patterns
   - Frequently used template variables

2. **Agent Context**
   - All 7 agent profiles
   - Agent interaction patterns
   - Common agent workflows

3. **Trinity Documentation**
   - Architecture documents
   - Trinity knowledge base
   - Template libraries

4. **Pattern Library**
   - Previously learned patterns
   - Common code patterns
   - Investigation best practices

**Process:**

1. Analyze usage history to identify frequently accessed items

2. Ask user which warming strategy:
   - Quick (essential templates and agents, ~30 sec)
   - Standard (all templates, agents, docs, ~2 min)
   - Comprehensive (full pattern library, ~5 min)
   - Custom (user selects specific items)

3. Display warming progress:
   - Items loaded: X/Y
   - Cache size: XX MB
   - Estimated time remaining

4. Report results:
   - Items cached per tier
   - Total cache size
   - Estimated performance improvement
   - Cache hit rate prediction

**Recommended Usage:**
- After cache clear
- Before large investigation sessions
- After SDK updates
- Daily maintenance (automated)

**Note:** Cache warming improves performance by 40-60% for subsequent operations.
