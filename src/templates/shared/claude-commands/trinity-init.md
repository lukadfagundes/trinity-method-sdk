description: Complete Trinity integration (TAN, ZEN, INO, then JUNO audit)
---

Complete the Trinity Method integration for this project.

**Context:** User has run `trinity deploy` and basic Trinity structure exists. Deployment team will now populate and verify all Trinity documents.

**IMPORTANT:** All folders and basic files already exist from deployment. DO NOT attempt to create folders that already exist (trinity/, .claude/, trinity-hooks/, etc.). Focus on POPULATING and VERIFYING content.

**Process:**
1. **TAN (Structure Specialist)** - Verify Trinity structure:
   - Check that all folders exist (they should from deploy)
   - Verify folder permissions
   - Report any structural issues (don't create folders - they already exist)

2. **ZEN (Knowledge Base Specialist)** - Populate Trinity documentation:
   - Analyze existing codebase
   - POPULATE trinity/knowledge-base/ARCHITECTURE.md with detailed architecture analysis
   - POPULATE trinity/knowledge-base/ISSUES.md with discovered issues
   - POPULATE trinity/knowledge-base/To-do.md with identified tasks
   - POPULATE trinity/knowledge-base/Technical-Debt.md with technical debt assessment
   - Update existing Trinity.md if needed

3. **INO (Context Specialist)** - Establish context hierarchy:
   - Analyze codebase context and complexity
   - UPDATE existing CLAUDE.md files with project-specific instructions
   - POPULATE trinity/knowledge-base/ISSUES.md database structure
   - Verify CLAUDE.md hierarchy is complete

4. **JUNO (Quality Auditor)** - Perform comprehensive audit:
   - Verify all folders exist and are writable
   - Verify all documentation files are populated (not empty)
   - Validate CLAUDE.md hierarchy completeness
   - Check that knowledge base documents have real content
   - Generate audit report in trinity/reports/
   - Report findings to user with compliance score

**Outcome:** Trinity Method fully integrated and audited, ready for first workflow.

**Note:** This command should be run once after initial deployment. The deployment created the structure; this command populates it with project-specific content.
