## ✅ AFTER COMPLETION

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Complete ALL Steps Below - NO EXCEPTIONS

**Step 1: Create Completion Report** ✅
   - [ ] Audit deliverable created in `${PROJECT_REPORTS}/`
   - [ ] Follow format: `AUDIT-[COMPONENT]-[TIMESTAMP].md`
   - [ ] JUNO audit report generated automatically (if applicable)
   - [ ] All deliverables include required sections listed above

**Step 2: 🚨 MOVE THIS WORK ORDER FILE 🚨** ✅
   - [ ] **IMMEDIATELY** move this file from `trinity/work-orders/` to `trinity/sessions/`
   - [ ] **THIS STEP IS MANDATORY** - Work orders left in trinity/work-orders/ are considered incomplete

   **Execute this exact command:**
   ```bash
   mv trinity/work-orders/{{workOrderFilename}} trinity/sessions/
   ```

**Step 3: Verify File Locations** ✅
   - [ ] This work order file NOW EXISTS in: `trinity/sessions/{{workOrderFilename}}`
   - [ ] Completion report exists in: `${PROJECT_REPORTS}/AUDIT-[COMPONENT]-[TIMESTAMP].md`
   - [ ] This work order NO LONGER EXISTS in: `trinity/work-orders/`

   **If any verification fails, the work order is NOT complete. Fix immediately.**

**Step 4: Session Cleanup (when entire session complete):**
   - [ ] When session is complete, run `/trinity-end`
   - [ ] trinity-end will archive ALL files from `trinity/sessions/` and `${PROJECT_REPORTS}/`
   - [ ] Next session starts with empty sessions/ and reports/ folders

**Archive Destination (via trinity-end):**
- Work order → `trinity/archive/work-orders/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Completion report → `trinity/archive/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- JUNO audit report → `trinity/archive/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/` (if applicable)
- Session summary → `trinity/archive/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/`

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

The audit is complete when:
- [ ] All specified components have been audited
- [ ] All compliance categories have been checked
- [ ] Mobile compliance verified (if UI audit)
- [ ] Metrics have been collected and analyzed
