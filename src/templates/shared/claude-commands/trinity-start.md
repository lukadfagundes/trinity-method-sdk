description: Guide through your first Trinity workflow
---

Guide the user through starting their first Trinity Method workflow.

Steps:
1. Ask what they want to work on (feature, bug fix, refactor, etc.)
2. Determine which Trinity agent is best suited:
   - Aly (CTO) - Strategic planning, architecture decisions
   - AJ (Implementation Lead) - Code implementation
   - TAN (Structure) - File organization, project structure
   - ZEN (Documentation) - Documentation updates
   - INO (Context) - Codebase analysis
   - Ein (CI/CD) - Deployment, testing, pipelines
   - JUNO (Quality) - Code review, quality audits

3. Suggest creating a work order if task is complex
4. Begin the workflow with appropriate agent context

For simple tasks, proceed directly. For complex tasks, use Trinity Work Order template.
