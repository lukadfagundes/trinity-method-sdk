MON: Requirements Analysis

Analyzing: User authentication system

Clarifying Questions:
1. Authentication method? (Email/password, OAuth, SSO, Magic link)
2. User registration flow? (Self-service, invite-only, admin-created)
3. Password requirements? (Complexity rules, reset flow)
4. Session management? (JWT, session cookies, duration)
5. Multi-factor authentication required?
6. Social login providers? (Google, GitHub, etc.)

[User provides answers]

Requirements Specification:
- Email/password authentication
- Self-service registration with email verification
- Password complexity: 8+ chars, uppercase, number, special char
- JWT-based sessions (7-day expiration, refresh tokens)
- Optional 2FA with TOTP (Google Authenticator)

**Example:**

```text
User: /trinity-design

ROR: Technical Design

Reviewing Requirements:
- User authentication system (MEDIUM scale)
- Email/password + social login
- JWT + refresh tokens
- Optional 2FA

Technical Design:

Architecture Pattern: Layered Architecture
- API Layer: Express.js REST endpoints
- Service Layer: Authentication business logic
- Data Layer: PostgreSQL (users, sessions, tokens)
- External: Email service (SendGrid), OAuth providers

ADR-001: Authentication Framework
Decision: Use Passport.js for authentication
Alternatives Considered: Custom JWT, Auth0, Firebase Auth
Rationale:
- Passport.js: Battle-tested, middleware-based, supports local + OAuth
- Custom JWT: Too much security risk to implement from scratch
- Auth0/Firebase: Vendor lock-in, additional cost
Consequences:
+ Proven security patterns
+ Large ecosystem of strategies
- Middleware learning curve

ADR-002: Password Hashing
Decision: bcrypt with 12 rounds
Alternatives Considered: scrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2
Rationale:
- bcrypt: Industry standard, Node.js native support
- Argon2: Better security but newer, less battle-tested
Consequences:
+ Well-understood security properties
+ Fast enough (12 rounds ~250ms)

ADR-003: Token Storage
Decision: httpOnly cookies for refresh tokens, memory for access tokens
Alternatives Considered: localStorage, sessionStorage
Rationale:
- httpOnly cookies: XSS protection
- Access tokens in memory: Refresh on page load
Consequences:
+ XSS protection
+ CSRF mitigation required

ADR-004: 2FA Implementation
Decision: TOTP with speakeasy library
Alternatives Considered: SMS 2FA, Email 2FA, WebAuthn
Rationale:
- TOTP: No SMS costs, better security than email
- WebAuthn: Not selected for v2.0.9, using TOTP
Consequences:
+ No additional service costs
+ User owns authenticator

Component Design:

1. Authentication Service
   - register(email, password)
   - login(email, password)
   - refreshToken(refreshToken)
   - logout(userId)
   - verify2FA(userId, token)

2. OAuth Service
   - initiateOAuth(provider)
   - handleOAuthCallback(provider, code)
   - linkOAuthAccount(userId, provider, profile)

3. Token Service
   - generateAccessToken(userId)
   - generateRefreshToken(userId)
   - verifyToken(token)
   - revokeToken(tokenId)

4. Email Service
   - sendVerificationEmail(email, token)
   - sendPasswordResetEmail(email, token)
   - send2FAEnrollmentEmail(email)

Database Schema:

users:
- id (UUID, primary key)
- email (unique, indexed)
- password_hash
- email_verified (boolean)
- created_at, updated_at

oauth_accounts:
- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (foreign key)
- provider (google, github)
- provider_user_id
- access_token (encrypted)

refresh_tokens:
- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (foreign key)
- token_hash
- expires_at
- revoked (boolean)

totp_secrets:
- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (foreign key)
- secret (encrypted)
- enabled (boolean)
- backup_codes (encrypted array)

API Endpoints:

POST   /api/auth/register
POST   /api/auth/login
POST   /api/auth/refresh
POST   /api/auth/logout
POST   /api/auth/password-reset-request
POST   /api/auth/password-reset
GET    /api/auth/verify-email/:token
POST   /api/auth/2fa/enroll
POST   /api/auth/2fa/verify
POST   /api/auth/2fa/disable
GET    /api/auth/oauth/:provider
GET    /api/auth/oauth/:provider/callback

Security Considerations:
- Rate limiting: 5 requests/min per IP on auth endpoints
- CORS: Whitelist allowed origins
- CSRF tokens for cookie-based sessions
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- Password strength validation
- Email verification required before login
- Refresh token rotation
- Token revocation on logout
- Audit logging for auth events

Performance Targets:
- Login: < 300ms (including bcrypt)
- Registration: < 500ms (including email send)
- Token refresh: < 100ms
- 2FA verification: < 200ms

### `/trinity-breakdown`

**Location:** `.claude/commands/execution/trinity-breakdown.md`
**Agents:** AJ MAESTRO (Orchestration Coordinator) — instructs, user implements

**Purpose:** Guided step-by-step implementation where the user makes all edits

**When to Use:**

- Want to learn and understand every change
- Prefer hands-on implementation with expert guidance
- Want to review each change before applying it
- Learning a new codebase through guided implementation

**What It Does:**

1. Analyzes task (work order, investigation, or description)
2. AJ MAESTRO selects agent persona(s) for guidance
3. Presents each change as structured step-by-step instructions
4. Provides file paths, line numbers, code changes, and explanations
5. Guides user through verification at each step
6. Summarizes all changes on completion

**Usage:**

```text
/trinity-breakdown
```

**Expected Output:**

- Step-by-step implementation instructions
- File paths and exact code changes
- Explanations for every change (WHY, not just WHAT)
- Verification checkpoints (build, lint, test)
- Completion summary

**Key Difference from `/trinity-orchestrate`:**

| Aspect         | `/trinity-orchestrate` | `/trinity-breakdown`      |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Who edits code | CC / KIL agents        | **You** (the user)        |
| CC's role      | Execute changes        | Explain what to change    |
| Output         | Commits and reports    | Step-by-step instructions |
| Learning       | Minimal                | **Maximum**               |

**Example:**

```text
User: /trinity-breakdown @WO-042-jwt-refresh-implementation.md

AJ MAESTRO: Reading work order WO-042...

I'll walk you through implementing JWT token refresh step by step.
You'll make all the edits — I'll tell you exactly what to change and why.

OVERVIEW:
- 4 files to create/modify
- 8 steps total
- You'll need: Your code editor and a terminal

STEP 1 of 8: Create the token refresh service file

FILE: src/services/token-refresh.service.ts
LOCATION: New file

WHAT TO DO:
Create a new file with the following content:

CODE:
[Exact code provided]

WHY:
This service encapsulates token generation logic...

VERIFY:
Save the file and run: npm run build

Ready for Step 2? (Say "next" to continue)

**Location:** `.claude/commands/maintenance/trinity-docs-update.md`
**Agent:** JUNO (Quality Auditor) + APO-1, APO-2, APO-3 (Documentation Specialists)

**Purpose:** Update existing documentation to reflect codebase changes using autonomous multi-agent orchestration

**When to Use:**

- Documentation has drifted from actual codebase behavior
- After significant code changes that affect documented APIs, commands, or architecture
- Periodic documentation accuracy maintenance
- When `docs/` directory already exists (created by `/trinity-docs`)

**What It Does:**

1. Verifies `docs/` directory exists (aborts if not -- run `/trinity-docs` first)
2. Launches JUNO to perform comprehensive documentation audit against actual codebase
3. JUNO generates audit report with categorized work assignments for three APO agents
4. Launches APO-1, APO-2, APO-3 in parallel to execute documentation updates
5. JUNO verifies APO completion status and restarts incomplete APOs if needed
6. JUNO performs final quality audit for accuracy and coverage
7. Loops verification until 100% completion and accuracy achieved

**Usage:**

```text
/trinity-docs-update
```

**Expected Output:**

- Comprehensive documentation audit report (`.claude/trinity/reports/DOCS-UPDATE-AUDIT-{date}.md`)
- Individual APO checklists tracking task completion (`.claude/trinity/reports/apo-{1,2,3}-docs-update-checklist.md`)
- Updated documentation files across `docs/` reflecting current codebase reality
- Final verification report (`.claude/trinity/reports/DOCS-UPDATE-VERIFICATION-{date}.md`)
- 100% documentation accuracy against source code

**Example:**

```text
User: /trinity-docs-update

Phase 0: Pre-Flight Check
  docs/ directory exists

Phase 1: JUNO Comprehensive Audit
  Reading codebase source files...
  Comparing against existing documentation...
  21 discrepancies identified across 12 documentation files

  Audit Report: .claude/trinity/reports/DOCS-UPDATE-AUDIT-2025-12-28.md

  Work Assignments:
  - APO-1: 24 base documentation fixes (counts, versions, categories)
  - APO-2: 12 API documentation accuracy fixes (deploy/update docs)
  - APO-3: 4 items (new command documentation + verification)

Phase 2: APO Documentation Updates (Parallel)
  Launching APO-1, APO-2, APO-3 simultaneously...

  APO-1: Updating slash-commands-reference.md, agents-quick-reference.md,
         getting-started.md, agent-guide.md, architecture/overview.md...
  APO-2: Updating deploy-command.md, deploy-agents.md, update-agents.md,
         update-summary.md...
  APO-3: Creating /trinity-docs-update documentation, verifying
         command template accuracy...

Phase 3: JUNO Verification Loop
  Step 3.1: Checking APO completion...
  - APO-1: 24/24 tasks complete (100%)
  - APO-2: 12/12 tasks complete (100%)
  - APO-3: 4/4 tasks complete (100%)
  PROCEED TO STEP 3.2

  Step 3.2: Final Quality Audit...
  - Coverage: 100% (all audit items addressed)
  - Accuracy: 100% (documentation matches codebase)
  VERIFICATION PASSED

Documentation update complete.
40 documentation items updated across 16 files.
All documentation now reflects current codebase state.
