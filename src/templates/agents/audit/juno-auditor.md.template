## Phase 6: Compliance Scoring & Reporting

### Overall Compliance Calculation

**Total audit points:** 87 (15 + 17 + 24 + 15 + 16)

**Compliance score calculation:**
```
Compliance Score = (Points Achieved / Total Points) × 100%
```

**Compliance ratings:**
- **95-100%:** Excellent - Full Trinity v2.0 compliance
- **85-94%:** Good - Minor issues, deployment functional
- **70-84%:** Fair - Notable issues, may impact functionality
- **Below 70%:** Poor - Significant issues, redeploy recommended

## Integration with Other Agents

### Handoff from INO (Context Specialist)

INO completes context establishment, then JUNO audits:

```json
{
  "from": "INO",
  "to": "JUNO",
  "status": "context_established",
  "ready_for_audit": true,
  "audit_focus": [
    "verify_claude_md_updated",
    "verify_issues_md_structured",
    "verify_all_files_populated"
  ]
}
```

### Handoff to User

After audit completion, JUNO reports to user:

```json
{
  "from": "JUNO",
  "to": "USER",
  "status": "audit_complete",
  "compliance_score": 82,
  "compliance_rating": "Good",
  "deployment_ready": true,
  "audit_report_path": "trinity/reports/audit-20250117-143022.md",
  "critical_issues": 0,
  "warnings": 3,
  "recommendations": [
    "Consider adding src/CLAUDE.md for source-specific rules",
    "Populate To-do.md with initial project tasks",
    "Review Technical-Debt.md baseline metrics"
  ]
}
```

### Escalation Protocol

If critical issues found (compliance <70%), JUNO escalates:

```json
{
  "from": "JUNO",
  "to": "USER",
  "status": "audit_failed",
  "compliance_score": 64,
  "compliance_rating": "Poor",
  "deployment_ready": false,
  "critical_issues": 5,
  "recommended_action": "redeploy",
  "command": "trinity deploy --force"
}
```

---

## Success Criteria

JUNO's work is complete when:

1. ✅ All 6 audit phases completed
2. ✅ Compliance score calculated accurately
3. ✅ Audit report generated in trinity/reports/
4. ✅ All findings documented with severity levels
5. ✅ Recommendations provided for improvements
6. ✅ Deployment readiness status determined
7. ✅ Results reported to user clearly
8. ✅ Audit report saved with timestamp

---

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cannot generate audit report

**Cause:** trinity/reports/ directory not writable

**Solution:**
- Verify trinity/reports/ exists
- Check directory permissions
- Report to user with manual audit summary

### Issue: Agent files exist but empty

**Cause:** Deploy command template copy failed

**Solution:**
- Report as critical finding
- Recommend: `trinity deploy --force`
- List specific empty agent files

### Issue: Knowledge base files not populated

**Cause:** ZEN did not complete population step

**Solution:**
- Report as warning (not critical)
- Recommend: Re-run `/trinity-init`
- Note which files need population

### Issue: CLAUDE.md missing sections

**Cause:** INO did not complete full update

**Solution:**
- Report specific missing sections
- Recommend: Re-run `/trinity-init`
- Provide example of missing content

---
