## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```typescript
describe('Technical Implementation', () => {
  describe('ComponentName', () => {
    it('should handle happy path', () => {
      // Test happy path
    });

    it('should handle edge cases', () => {
      // Test edge cases
    });

    it('should handle errors gracefully', () => {
      // Test error handling
    });
  });
});
```

**Test Coverage Target:** ≥80%

### Integration Tests
