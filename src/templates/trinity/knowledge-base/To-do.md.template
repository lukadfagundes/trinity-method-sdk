## 📝 WHEN TO UPDATE THIS DOCUMENT

This is a **living task management system** updated continuously as work progresses.

### Immediate Updates Required ⚠️

Update **as tasks change** (real-time):

- ✅ **Task Completed**: Mark complete or remove from list immediately
- ✅ **New Task Identified**: Add to appropriate priority section (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- ✅ **Priority Change**: Move tasks between priority levels as urgency changes
- ✅ **Task Blocked**: Update status, add blocker details
- ✅ **Subtasks Discovered**: Add subtask checklist to existing task

### Session Updates (Via `/trinity-end`) 🔄

Update at end of each development session:

- Remove/mark completed tasks from session
- Add new tasks discovered during development
- Re-prioritize based on new information
- Update sprint planning (velocity, burndown)
- Calculate session productivity metrics
- Update backlog with new items

### Weekly Reviews ⏰

Sprint planning and prioritization:

- Review P0/P1 items (ensure highest priority work identified)
- Update sprint status (tasks completed vs planned)
- Calculate velocity (tasks per week)
- Reprioritize backlog
- Archive completed tasks if desired

### Cross-Document Update Triggers 🔗

**When updating To-do.md, also check:**

- **[ISSUES.md](./ISSUES.md)**: Close issues when related tasks complete
- **[Technical-Debt.md](./Technical-Debt.md)**: Update when debt-related tasks complete
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Verify architecture changes documented when component tasks complete

### Update Scenarios - What to Change

**Scenario: Bug Fixed**
```yaml
Updates_Required:
  - Active_Tasks: Remove or mark complete the fix task
  - Sprint_Status: Update completed task count
  - Velocity_Tracking: Add to completed tasks this week
  - Cross_References:
    - ISSUES.md: Close the related issue
    - Technical-Debt.md: Update if fix paid down debt
```

**Scenario: New Feature Request**
```yaml
Updates_Required:
  - Backlog: Add new task with description
  - Priority_Assignment: Assign P0/P1/P2/P3 based on urgency
  - Estimate: Add time/complexity estimate
  - Dependencies: Link to related tasks if applicable
```

**Scenario: Task Blocked**
```yaml
Updates_Required:
  - Task_Status: Update with blocker details
  - Priority: May need to reprioritize
  - New_Tasks: May need to create unblocking tasks
  - Cross_References:
    - ISSUES.md: Create issue for blocker if recurring
```

**Scenario: Sprint Completed**
```yaml
Updates_Required:
  - Archive_Completed: Move completed tasks to archive or remove
  - Sprint_Metrics: Calculate velocity, completion rate
  - Next_Sprint: Move high-priority backlog items to active
  - Velocity_Adjustment: Update estimates based on actual velocity
```

### How to Update

**Step-by-step process:**

1. **Identify Change**: Task complete, new task, priority change, or blocked?
2. **Update Section**: Modify appropriate priority section or backlog
3. **Cross-Reference**: Check if ISSUES/Technical-Debt need updates
4. **Recalculate Metrics**: Update velocity, sprint status if needed
5. **Update Timestamp**: Set `**Last Updated**: {{CURRENT_DATE}}`

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] All tasks have clear descriptions (what needs to be done)
- [ ] Priorities accurate (P0 = urgent, P3 = low priority)
- [ ] Estimates reasonable (based on team velocity)
- [ ] Blocked tasks have blocker details
- [ ] Completed tasks removed or marked complete
- [ ] Related issues/debt items cross-referenced

### When NOT to Update ❌

**Don't add to To-do.md if:**
- Already documented in ISSUES.md as a bug (use issue tracking instead)
- Not actionable (vague idea without clear next steps)
- Belongs in Technical-Debt.md (debt tracking, not task)
- Long-term strategic item (add to ARCHITECTURE evolution planning)

### Task vs. Issue vs. Debt 🤔

**Add to To-do.md when:**
- Specific action item to complete
- Feature to implement
- Bug to fix (with clear reproduction)
- Refactoring work planned
- Investigation to conduct

**Add to ISSUES.md when:**
- Bug that can recur
- Pattern to track
- Framework-specific problem

**Add to Technical-Debt.md when:**
- Code quality metric (TODO count, complexity)
- Accumulated shortcut
- Technical burden to track

**Tasks often resolve issues and debt** (todo → fix → issue closed, debt reduced).
