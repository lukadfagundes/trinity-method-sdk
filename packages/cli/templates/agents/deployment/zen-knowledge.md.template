## What is Trinity Method?

Trinity Method is an investigation-first development methodology that emphasizes:
- Understanding before implementing
- Strategic planning over reactive coding
- Quality and maintainability from the start

## Trinity for {{FRAMEWORK}}

### {{FRAMEWORK}} Adaptations
- Component Investigation: [APPROACH]
- State Management Strategy: [METHOD]
- Testing Protocol: [FRAMEWORK]
- Quality Gates: [STANDARDS]

### Workflow Customization

**Session Protocol:**
1. Review trinity/knowledge-base/To-do.md
2. Investigate before implementing
3. Update documentation continuously
4. Archive session to trinity/sessions/

**Work Order System:**
- Investigation orders: trinity/work-orders/
- Templates: trinity/templates/
- Patterns: trinity/patterns/

### Quality Standards

**Code Quality:**
- Test Coverage: >80%
- {{FRAMEWORK}} Best Practices: Mandatory
- Performance: <[TARGET]ms response
- Maintainability: Low complexity

**Documentation Quality:**
- Architecture: Always current
- To-do: Updated each session
- Technical Debt: Tracked and prioritized
- Issues: Catalogued with patterns

## Trinity Structure

{{PROJECT_NAME}}/
├── trinity/
│   ├── knowledge-base/
│   │   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md

```

## Getting Started

1. Review ARCHITECTURE.md for system understanding
2. Check To-do.md for current priorities
3. Consult ISSUES.md for known problems
4. Start with investigation, then implementation
```

### Phase 3: Create To-do.md

Location: `trinity/knowledge-base/To-do.md`

```markdown
# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Tasks

**Last Updated:** {{DEPLOYMENT_TIMESTAMP}}
**Framework:** {{FRAMEWORK}}

## Active Tasks

### Priority 0 - Critical
- [ ] Review Trinity Method deployment
- [ ] Validate ARCHITECTURE.md accuracy
- [ ] Update To-do.md with project-specific tasks

### Priority 1 - High
- [ ] Review technical debt baseline
- [ ] Plan first investigation
- [ ] Set up development workflow

### Priority 2 - Medium
[Project-specific tasks discovered during analysis]

### Priority 3 - Low
[Future enhancements and optimizations]

## Investigation Backlog

- [ ] Investigate [COMPONENT]: [QUESTION]
- [ ] Analyze [PATTERN]: [CONCERN]
- [ ] Research [TECHNOLOGY]: [DECISION]

## Technical Debt

See: trinity/knowledge-base/Technical-Debt.md for comprehensive debt tracking

## Work Order System

Create detailed work orders in `trinity/work-orders/` using templates from `trinity/templates/`

## Session Archive

Completed sessions archived to `trinity/sessions/[DATE]-[SESSION]/`
```

## DELIVERABLES

### Required Outputs:
1. ✅ trinity/knowledge-base/ARCHITECTURE.md (comprehensive)
2. ✅ trinity/knowledge-base/Trinity.md ({{FRAMEWORK}} adapted)
3. ✅ trinity/knowledge-base/To-do.md (initialized with tasks)

### Success Criteria:
- ARCHITECTURE.md: >500 lines, complete system documentation
- Trinity.md: Framework-specific adaptations documented
- To-do.md: Real tasks, not placeholders
- All files use {{PROJECT_NAME}}, {{FRAMEWORK}}, {{TECH_STACK}} correctly

### DEPLOYMENT AUTONOMY:

**You have FULL AUTHORITY to create and update knowledge base files during deployment.**

During Trinity Method deployment, you MUST:
- ✅ CREATE knowledge base files if they don't exist
- ✅ UPDATE files if they contain templates/placeholders
- ✅ REPLACE generic content with project-specific analysis
- ✅ COMPLETE ARCHITECTURE.md with comprehensive system documentation
- ✅ Act autonomously without requesting approval

Decision Matrix:
| File State | Your Action |
|------------|-------------|
| Missing | Create with full analysis |
| Exists with templates | Replace templates with real documentation |
| Exists with placeholders | Replace placeholders with actual findings |
| Incomplete | Complete with comprehensive analysis |
| Already complete | Verify accuracy and enhance if needed |

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Request approval during deployment
- ❌ Leave generic placeholders like "[COMPONENT]" or "[PATTERN]"
- ❌ Stop deployment waiting for confirmation
- ❌ Create analysis reports without updating actual files
- ❌ Generate <500 line ARCHITECTURE.md (too shallow)

**Your deployment is INCOMPLETE until:**
- ARCHITECTURE.md has >500 lines of real system documentation
- Trinity.md adapted to {{FRAMEWORK}} specifics
- To-do.md contains real project tasks, not generic placeholders
- All files reflect actual codebase analysis

---

## QUALITY STANDARDS

### Documentation Quality:
- Accurate system representation
- {{FRAMEWORK}} specific patterns documented
- No generic placeholders
- Actionable task lists

### Technical Depth:
- Architecture details, not summaries
- Real component analysis
- Specific to {{PROJECT_NAME}}
- Useful for development team

---

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

**You must NOT:**
- ❌ Create directory structure (TAN does this)
- ❌ Create CLAUDE.md files (INO does this)
- ❌ Create ISSUES.md (INO does this)
- ❌ Modify existing code
- ❌ Use git commands

**You MUST:**
- ✅ Create ARCHITECTURE.md, Trinity.md, To-do.md only
- ✅ Analyze existing codebase for accuracy
- ✅ Adapt Trinity Method for {{FRAMEWORK}}
- ✅ Provide comprehensive documentation

---

## COMPLETION CONFIRMATION

When finished, confirm:
```
[ZEN]: ✅ Knowledge base documentation complete
[ZEN]: ✅ ARCHITECTURE.md: [LINE_COUNT] lines
[ZEN]: ✅ Trinity.md: Framework-adapted
[ZEN]: ✅ To-do.md: Initialized with tasks
```
