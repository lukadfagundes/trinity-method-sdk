description: Primary command for executing tasks with AJ MAESTRO orchestration
---

# Trinity Orchestration

**Purpose:** Primary command for executing tasks during development sessions. AJ MAESTRO coordinates the 19-agent team to complete work, with automatic JUNO verification.

**Use throughout your session:** This command is used repeatedly as you work through tasks.

---

## Overview

`/trinity-orchestrate` is the **main execution command** in Trinity Method development. After you start a session with `/trinity-start` or `/trinity-continue`, you'll use this command repeatedly to execute work orders, perform investigations, and complete general tasks.

**Development Session Flow:**

```
/trinity-start or /trinity-continue
    ↓
/trinity-orchestrate (PRIMARY LOOP - used repeatedly)
    ↓
/trinity-end
```

**A session = User actively working with Claude Code**
**A session ≠ Claude Code's context window** (documentation persists across context boundaries)

---

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Orchestrate Work Orders (Formal Tasks)

```bash
/trinity-orchestrate @WO-XXX-{task-name}.md
```

**When to use:**

- Complex tasks requiring formal tracking
- Multi-step implementations
- Tasks spanning multiple context windows
- Work that needs quality verification

**Workflow:**

1. Create work order: `/trinity-workorder`
2. Work order saved to: `trinity/work-orders/WO-XXX-{task-name}.md`
3. Execute: `/trinity-orchestrate @WO-042-jwt-refresh.md`
4. **AJ MAESTRO** selects agents and orchestrates execution
5. **TWO DELIVERABLES CREATED:**
   a. **Implementation Report** (from work order template):
   `trinity/reports/[COMPONENT]-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE-{timestamp}.md`
   b. **JUNO Audit Report** (automatic verification):
   `trinity/reports/AUDIT-WO-042-{date}.md`
6. **Move completed work order** from `trinity/work-orders/` to `trinity/sessions/`
7. **Reports remain** in `trinity/reports/` until session end
8. **Run `/trinity-end`** when session complete to archive all session files

**Example:**

```bash
/trinity-orchestrate @WO-042-jwt-refresh-implementation.md
```

---

### 2. Orchestrate Investigations (READ-ONLY Analysis)

```bash
/trinity-orchestrate @INV-XXX-{title}.md
```

**When to use:**

- Bug analysis and root cause investigation
- Performance investigation
- Security audits
- Technical decision research
- Architecture review

**Workflow:**

1. Create investigation: `/trinity-create-investigation`
2. Investigation saved to: `trinity/investigations/INV-XXX-{title}.md`
3. Execute: `/trinity-orchestrate @INV-015-performance-analysis.md`
4. **AJ MAESTRO** coordinates READ-ONLY investigation
5. Findings documented (no code changes)
6. **Investigation Report Created:**
   `trinity/reports/INV-015-findings-{date}.md`
   (See investigation template for required sections)
7. **Move completed investigation** from `trinity/investigations/` to `trinity/sessions/`
8. **Report remains** in `trinity/reports/` until session end
9. **Run `/trinity-end`** when session complete to archive all session files

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Investigations are READ-ONLY operations. No code changes during investigation phase. Implementation happens separately after investigation is complete.

**Example:**

```bash
/trinity-orchestrate @INV-015-database-performance-analysis.md
```

---

### 3. Orchestrate General Tasks (Quick Tasks)

```bash
/trinity-orchestrate "Task description"
```

**When to use:**

- Quick fixes without formal work order
- Simple bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Configuration changes
- Exploratory work

**How it works:**

- AJ MAESTRO assesses task complexity
- Selects appropriate agents
- Executes with quality gates
- JUNO verifies completion
- No work order file needed

**Example:**

```bash
/trinity-orchestrate "Fix date validation bug in UserForm component"
```

**When to create work order instead:**

- Task affects 3+ files
- Implementation will take >2 hours
- Need formal tracking across context windows
- Complex enough to need planning phases

---

## AJ MAESTRO's Orchestration Process

When you invoke `/trinity-orchestrate`, here's what happens:

### Step 1: Task Analysis

**AJ MAESTRO reads and analyzes:**

- Work order file (if @WO-XXX provided)
- Investigation file (if @INV-XXX provided)
- Task description (if general task)

**Determines:**

- Task complexity and scope
- Required expertise areas
- Which agents are needed
- Quality gate requirements

---

### Step 2: Agent Selection

**AJ MAESTRO selects the best agent(s) for each phase:**

**Planning Agents:**

- **MON** - Requirements analysis, acceptance criteria, scale determination
- **ROR** - Technical design, function signatures, ADR documentation
- **TRA** - Strategic planning, task sequencing, timeline estimation
- **EUS** - Atomic task decomposition (1 task = 1 commit)

**Execution Agents:**

- **KIL** - TDD implementation (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle)
- **BAS** - 6-phase quality gate validation
- **DRA** - Code review and Design Doc compliance verification

**Support Agents:**

- **APO** - API documentation and inline code comments
- **BON** - Dependency management and security scanning
- **CAP** - Configuration files and environment management
- **URO** - Code refactoring and technical debt reduction

**Audit Agent:**

- **JUNO** - Comprehensive quality audit and compliance verification

**Selection Criteria:**

- Small tasks (1-2 files): Direct to KIL + BAS
- Medium tasks (3-5 files): MON → ROR → TRA → KIL + BAS → DRA
- Large tasks (6+ files): Full agent workflow including EUS and JUNO

---

### Step 3: Coordinate Execution

**AJ MAESTRO manages the workflow:**

1. **Hands off to selected agent(s)**
   - Provides full context from work order/investigation
   - Ensures agent has all necessary information
   - Monitors agent progress

2. **Manages agent transitions**
   - Coordinates handoffs between agents
   - Ensures context preservation
   - Handles dependencies between phases

3. **Ensures quality gates are met**
   - BAS validates after each commit
   - DRA reviews before completion
   - Escalates issues if quality standards not met

4. **Handles escalations**
   - If complexity exceeds initial assessment
   - If blockers are encountered
   - If quality gates fail

---

### Step 4: JUNO Verification (Automatic)

**After task completion, JUNO automatically verifies:**

**Quality Criteria Checked:**

1. ✅ **BAS Quality Gates** - All 6 phases passed
   - Linting, structure, build, tests, coverage (≥80%), best practices

2. ✅ **Work Order Objectives** - All objectives met
   - Deliverables completed
   - Acceptance criteria satisfied

3. ✅ **Test Coverage** - Tests passing with adequate coverage
   - Unit tests for new code
   - Integration tests where applicable
   - Edge cases covered

4. ✅ **Documentation** - Updated appropriately
   - Code comments (if needed)
   - API documentation (if API changed)
   - README updates (if user-facing)

5. ✅ **Design Doc Compliance** - Follows design (if applicable)
   - Function signatures match design
   - Architecture decisions followed
   - Compliance score ≥70%

6. ✅ **Technical Debt** - No new debt introduced
   - No TODOs without tickets
   - No code duplication
   - Complexity within limits

**JUNO's Audit Report:**

- Saved to: `trinity/reports/AUDIT-{task-id}-{date}.md`
- Pass/Fail status for each criterion
- Overall assessment (APPROVED / REQUIRES FIXES)
- Recommendations for improvements
- Follow-up work orders (if issues found)

**What You See:**

```
JUNO: Audit complete ✅
- BAS gates: PASS ✅
- Test coverage: 92% ✅ (exceeds 80% threshold)
- Design Doc compliance: 85% ✅
- Technical debt: 0 new issues ✅
- Overall: APPROVED ✅

Task WO-042-jwt-refresh-implementation is complete and verified.
```

**If Issues Found:**

```
JUNO: Audit complete ⚠️
- BAS gates: PASS ✅
- Test coverage: 68% ❌ (below 80% threshold)
- Design Doc compliance: 75% ✅
- Overall: REQUIRES FIXES ⚠️

Recommendation: Add tests for error handling edge cases
Created follow-up: WO-043-jwt-test-coverage

Please address WO-043 before marking WO-042 complete.
```

---

### Step 5: Report to User

**AJ MAESTRO provides completion summary:**

- Work completed overview
- JUNO audit results (PASS/FAIL)
- Files changed and commits made
- Follow-up recommendations (if any)
- Next steps or follow-up work orders

---

## Session Workflow Context

### Development Session Lifecycle

**A development session:**

- Starts when user begins working (via `/trinity-start` or `/trinity-continue`)
- Continues with repeated `/trinity-orchestrate` invocations
- Ends when user finishes working (via `/trinity-end`)
- Is NOT tied to Claude Code's context window

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         TRINITY DEVELOPMENT SESSION                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. START SESSION
   ├─ /trinity-start (new session - includes workflow planning)
   └─ OR /trinity-continue (resume interrupted session)

2. EXECUTE TASKS (PRIMARY LOOP) ← MOST OF YOUR TIME
   │
   ├─ /trinity-orchestrate @WO-042.md
   │  └─ AJ MAESTRO → Agents → JUNO → Report
   │
   ├─ /trinity-orchestrate @INV-015.md
   │  └─ AJ MAESTRO → Investigation → JUNO → Findings
   │
   ├─ /trinity-orchestrate "Quick fix"
   │  └─ AJ MAESTRO → Quick execution → JUNO → Done
   │
   └─ Repeat as needed throughout your session

3. END SESSION
   └─ /trinity-end
      ├─ Archive completed work
      ├─ Update knowledge base
      └─ Create session summary
```

---

## After Task Completion Workflow

### When You've Completed a Work Order or Investigation

**Step 1: Verify Deliverables Created**

**Work Orders:**

- [ ] Implementation report in `trinity/reports/[COMPONENT]-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE-{timestamp}.md`
- [ ] JUNO audit report in `trinity/reports/AUDIT-WO-XXX-{date}.md` (if applicable)

**Investigations:**

- [ ] Findings report in `trinity/reports/INV-XXX-findings-{date}.md`
- [ ] All required sections completed (summary, findings, root cause, recommendations, evidence)

**Step 2: Move Completed File to Sessions**

```bash
# Work Order Example
mv trinity/work-orders/WO-042-jwt-refresh.md trinity/sessions/

# Investigation Example
mv trinity/investigations/INV-015-performance-analysis.md trinity/sessions/
```

**Step 3: Continue Working or End Session**

**If continuing work in same session:**

- Reports remain in `trinity/reports/` (available for reference)
- Completed WOs/INVs in `trinity/sessions/` (out of active work queue)
- Proceed with next task

**If session is complete:**

```bash
/trinity-end
```

This will:

- Archive ALL files from `trinity/sessions/` → `trinity/archive/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Archive ALL files from `trinity/reports/` → `trinity/archive/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Archive completed work orders → `trinity/archive/work-orders/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Archive completed investigations → `trinity/archive/investigations/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Create session summary in `trinity/archive/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- **Result:** Clean `trinity/sessions/` and `trinity/reports/` folders for next session

---

## Session File Organization

**Active Session:**

```
trinity/
├── work-orders/          # Active work orders (not yet completed)
├── investigations/       # Active investigations (not yet completed)
├── sessions/            # Completed WOs/INVs (awaiting archival)
├── reports/             # All session reports (awaiting archival)
```

**After /trinity-end:**

```
trinity/
├── work-orders/          # EMPTY (all active work complete or in-progress only)
├── investigations/       # EMPTY (all active investigations complete or in-progress only)
├── sessions/            # EMPTY (all archived)
├── reports/             # EMPTY (all archived)
├── archive/
│   ├── work-orders/YYYY-MM-DD/    # Completed work orders
│   ├── investigations/YYYY-MM-DD/ # Completed investigations
│   ├── reports/YYYY-MM-DD/        # All session reports
│   └── sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/       # Session summaries
```

**Clean Slate:** Every new session starts with empty sessions/ and reports/ folders.

---

### Context Window Management

**Key Understanding:**

- **Session** = You working at the computer
- **Context Window** = Claude Code's current memory limit
- **Sessions can span multiple context windows**

**How Trinity Handles Context Loss:**

1. **Documentation Persists:**
   - Work orders: `trinity/work-orders/WO-XXX.md`
   - Investigations: `trinity/investigations/INV-XXX.md`
   - JUNO reports: `trinity/reports/AUDIT-*.md`
   - Knowledge base: `trinity/knowledge-base/*.md`

2. **When Context Window Is Exceeded:**
   - Current work is automatically documented
   - Session state saved to `trinity/sessions/SESSION-{timestamp}.md`
   - Use `/trinity-continue` to resume
   - AJ MAESTRO reads files to understand current state
   - JUNO reports show what's been completed
   - Work continues seamlessly

3. **Recovery Process (`/trinity-continue`):**
   - ALY (CTO) analyzes current state from files
   - Reviews work orders, investigations, reports
   - Provides session summary
   - Recommends how to proceed
   - Hands off to AJ MAESTRO to continue

**Example:**

```
[Context window limit approaching during WO-042]

System: Context window at 95%. Documenting current state...
[Saves progress to work order file and session log]

[User starts new context window]

User: /trinity-continue

ALY: Analyzing session state...
- Work Order: WO-042 (50% complete, 3/6 tasks done)
- Last activity: Implementing middleware (Task 3)
- Uncommitted changes: src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts

Recommendation: Resume with AJ MAESTRO to complete WO-042.

Shall I hand off to AJ MAESTRO to continue?

User: Yes

AJ MAESTRO: Resuming WO-042... Reading current state...
[Continues from Task 4]
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Work Order Execution

````
User: /trinity-orchestrate @WO-042-jwt-refresh-implementation.md

AJ MAESTRO: Reading work order WO-042...

**Analysis:**
- Task: JWT token refresh implementation
- Complexity: MEDIUM (4 files affected)
- Estimated time: 4-6 hours
- Agents needed: MON → ROR → TRA → KIL + BAS → DRA → JUNO

**Execution Plan:**
1. Requirements analysis (MON)
2. Technical design (ROR)
3. Implementation planning (TRA)
4. TDD implementation (KIL + BAS)
5. Code review (DRA)
6. Final audit (JUNO)

Proceeding...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Phase 1: Requirements (MON)**

MON: Analyzing work order requirements...

✅ Functional Requirements:
- Automatic token refresh on expiry
- HttpOnly cookie storage
- Race condition handling

✅ Acceptance Criteria:
- Given: User has expired token
- When: Authenticated request is made
- Then: Token refreshes automatically without user action

✅ Risks Identified:
- Race conditions with concurrent requests
- Token theft if not properly secured

Requirements analysis complete.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Phase 2: Technical Design (ROR)**

ROR: Creating technical design...

✅ Function Signatures:
```typescript
interface RefreshTokenOptions {
  expiryBuffer: number; // milliseconds before expiry to refresh
}

async refreshToken(userId: string, options: RefreshTokenOptions): Promise<TokenPair>
async validateAndRefreshIfNeeded(token: string): Promise<TokenPair | null>
````

✅ Architecture Decision Record (ADR):

- Decision: Use HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens
- Rationale: Prevents XSS attacks, more secure than localStorage
- Trade-offs: Slightly more complex server-side management

Design complete. Design Doc compliance criteria: ≥70%

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Phase 3: Implementation Planning (TRA)**

TRA: Creating implementation plan...

✅ Task Breakdown:

2. Implement refresh middleware
3. Add token validation logic
4. Handle race conditions (mutex)
5. Add error handling
6. Write unit tests
7. Write integration tests
8. Update API documentation

Sequencing: Tasks 1-2 must complete before 3-4 (dependencies)
Tasks 6-7 can run in parallel (independent)

Estimated time: 4-6 hours (with 20% parallelization savings)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Phase 4: Implementation (KIL + BAS)**

KIL: Beginning TDD implementation...

**Task 1/8: Create token refresh service**

RED: Writing failing test...

```typescript
describe('TokenRefreshService', () => {
  it('should refresh token before expiry', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

❌ Test fails (expected - no implementation yet)

GREEN: Implementing minimal code...

```typescript
class TokenRefreshService {
  async refreshToken(userId: string, options: RefreshTokenOptions) {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

✅ Test passes

### Example 2: Investigation Execution

```

User: /trinity-orchestrate @INV-015-database-performance-analysis.md

AJ MAESTRO: Reading investigation INV-015...

**Analysis:**

- Type: Performance Investigation (READ-ONLY)
- Scope: Database query performance degradation
- Evidence: API response time increased 300%
- Agents needed: Investigation workflow (READ-ONLY mode)

⚠️ **Investigation Mode:** No code changes will be made.

Proceeding with investigation...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Phase 1: Data Collection**

Collecting performance metrics...
✅ APM traces collected (last 7 days)
✅ Database slow query log analyzed
✅ Query execution plans captured
✅ Resource utilization metrics gathered

**Key Findings:**

- Average query time: 2.3s (was 0.5s)
- Slowest query: getUserOrders (5.2s average)
- Execution count: 500+ queries per page load

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Phase 2: Analysis**

Analyzing query patterns...

**Root Cause Identified:**
❌ **N+1 Query Pattern in getUserOrders**

```sql
-- Main query (executed once)
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 123;

-- N+1 queries (executed 500 times!)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?;  -- For each order
```

**Missing Indexes Found:**
❌ No index on `orders.user_id`
❌ No index on `user_metadata.user_id`
❌ No compound index on `orders(user_id, created_at)`

**Performance Impact:**

- Full table scans on 100k+ row tables
- 500+ individual queries instead of 1 JOIN
- No query result caching

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Phase 3: Recommendations**

**Recommendation 1: Add Database Indexes**
Priority: HIGH
Estimated effort: 2 hours
Expected improvement: 60-70% reduction in query time

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_metadata_user_id ON user_metadata(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_created ON orders(user_id, created_at);
```

**Recommendation 2: Fix N+1 Query Pattern**
Priority: HIGH
Estimated effort: 3 hours
Expected improvement: 80% reduction in query count

```typescript
// Current (N+1 queries)
const orders = await Order.findAll({ where: { userId } });
for (const order of orders) {
  order.user = await User.findByPk(order.userId); // N queries!
}

// Fixed (1 query with JOIN)
const orders = await Order.findAll({
  where: { userId },
  include: [{ model: User }], // Eager loading
});
```

**Recommendation 3: Implement Query Result Caching**
Priority: MEDIUM
Estimated effort: 4 hours
Expected improvement: Additional 40% improvement for repeated queries

```typescript
const cacheKey = `user_orders_${userId}`;
const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);
if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

const orders = await getOrdersWithUsers(userId);
await redis.set(cacheKey, JSON.stringify(orders), 'EX', 300); // 5 min TTL
```

**Total Expected Improvement:**

- Query time: 2.3s → 0.4s (83% improvement)
- Query count: 500+ → 1 (99.8% reduction)
- API response time: Within target (<500ms)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Phase 4: JUNO Audit**

JUNO: Auditing investigation completeness...

**Investigation Quality Check:**

1. Problem Statement: CLEAR ✅
2. Data Collection: COMPREHENSIVE ✅
3. Root Cause Analysis: EVIDENCE-BASED ✅
4. Recommendations: ACTIONABLE ✅
5. Effort Estimates: PROVIDED ✅

### Example 3: Quick Task (No Work Order)

```

User: /trinity-orchestrate "Fix date validation bug in UserForm component"

AJ MAESTRO: Analyzing task...

**Assessment:**

- Type: Bug fix
- Complexity: SMALL (1 file)
- Estimated time: <1 hour
- Approach: Direct implementation with BAS gates

I'll handle this without a formal work order.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Phase 1: Analysis**

Reviewing UserForm component...

**Bug Identified:**
❌ Date validation accepts invalid formats (e.g., "13/32/2025")
❌ No edge case handling for leap years
❌ Missing test coverage for date validation

**Fix Required:**

- Add proper date format validation
- Handle edge cases (leap years, invalid dates)
- Write comprehensive tests

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Phase 2: Implementation (TDD)**

**RED: Write failing tests**

```typescript
describe('UserForm date validation', () => {
  it('should reject invalid date formats', () => {
    expect(validateDate('13/32/2025')).toBe(false);
  });

  it('should handle leap years correctly', () => {
    expect(validateDate('02/29/2024')).toBe(true); // Leap year
    expect(validateDate('02/29/2023')).toBe(false); // Not leap year
  });
});
```

❌ Tests fail (expected - no validation yet)

**GREEN: Implement fix**

```typescript
function validateDate(dateStr: string): boolean {
  const date = new Date(dateStr);
  return date instanceof Date && !isNaN(date.getTime());
}
```

✅ Tests pass

**REFACTOR: Improve validation**

```typescript
function validateDate(dateStr: string): boolean {
  const date = new Date(dateStr);
  if (!(date instanceof Date) || isNaN(date.getTime())) {
    return false;
  }

  // Ensure date string round-trips correctly
  const roundTrip = date.toISOString().split('T')[0];
  return roundTrip === dateStr;
}
```

✅ Tests still pass, validation more robust

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Phase 3: BAS Quality Gates**

1. **Linting:** PASS ✅
   - Auto-fixed 1 formatting issue

2. **Structure:** PASS ✅
   - File organization correct

3. **Build:** PASS ✅
   - TypeScript compilation successful

4. **Testing:** PASS ✅
   - All 52 tests passing (added 5 new tests)

5. **Coverage:** 91% ✅
   - Exceeds 80% threshold
   - Edge cases covered

6. **Best Practices:** PASS ✅
   - Function complexity: LOW
   - No code duplication

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Phase 4: JUNO Verification**

JUNO: Verifying quick fix...

**Quality Check:**

1. Bug fixed: CONFIRMED ✅
2. Tests comprehensive: YES ✅
3. No regressions: VERIFIED ✅
4. Code quality: EXCELLENT ✅

## Summary

**Primary Development Command:** `/trinity-orchestrate` is your main execution command during development sessions.

**Key Points:**
1. **AJ MAESTRO orchestrates:** Selects best agents for each task
2. **JUNO verifies automatically:** Every task gets quality audit
3. **Used repeatedly:** Throughout your session, not just once
4. **Three usage patterns:** @WO-XXX (work orders), @INV-XXX (investigations), "description" (quick tasks)
5. **Session ≠ Context window:** Documentation persists, use `/trinity-continue` to resume

**Typical Session Flow:**
```bash
/trinity-start                                    # Begin session
/trinity-orchestrate @WO-042-jwt-refresh.md      # Execute work order
/trinity-orchestrate @INV-015-performance.md     # Investigate issue
/trinity-orchestrate "Fix validation bug"        # Quick fix
# ... repeat as needed throughout session ...
/trinity-end                                      # End session
````

**Next:** Describe your task, provide a work order/investigation file, or continue working on your current task. AJ MAESTRO will orchestrate execution with automatic JUNO verification.
