## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added

- **NEW: Trinity-docs-update command** - Comprehensive documentation update system for maintaining existing docs
  - **Command:** `/maintenance:trinity-docs-update` - Updates existing documentation to reflect codebase changes
  - **Architecture:** JUNO audit → 3 parallel APO instances → JUNO verification loop → Final quality audit
  - **Autonomous Execution:** Runs from start to finish without user intervention unless errors occur
  - **Version:** 2.0.9
  - **Last Updated:** 2026-01-19

- **Trinity-docs-update - JUNO audit system** - Phase 1 comprehensive codebase analysis with mandatory verification protocols
  - **Database Verification Protocol (Mandatory):**
    - Step 1: Detect database presence via bash detection script
    - Step 2: **MANDATORY** production database connection attempt if database detected
    - Documents connection info search (.env, docker-compose.yml, config files)
    - Documents connection attempt method and result (success/failure with reason)
    - Falls back to schema files ONLY after documented connection failure
    - Prevents documentation based on outdated schema files
  - **Environment Configuration Verification Protocol (All Projects):**
    - Priority 1: Check actual environment files (.env, .env.local) FIRST
    - Priority 2: Check template files (.env.example)
    - Priority 3: Check code defaults (|| fallback values)
    - Documents all findings and discrepancies
    - Source of truth order: Actual config > Template > Code defaults
    - **Prevents false positives:** Won't flag correct docs as wrong by verifying against actual config
  - **Business Logic Discovery:** Scans controllers, services, models, utilities at function-level granularity
  - **Output:** `trinity/reports/DOCS-UPDATE-AUDIT-{{DATE}}.md` with APO work assignments

- **Trinity-docs-update - Configuration false positive prevention** - Resolution rules prevent incorrect audit findings
  - **Resolution Rule 1:** If .env sets value X, then X is correct (docs showing X are correct)
  - **Resolution Rule 2:** Code defaults contradicting .env should be fixed (not docs)
  - **Resolution Rule 3:** Documentation showing actual config value is NEVER wrong
  - **Example:** Port 3001 in docs + .env, but code shows `|| 4000` → docs are correct, code default needs fixing
  - **Impact:** Eliminates false positives where JUNO would flag correct documentation as wrong

- **Trinity-docs-update - Scope boundary with consistency exceptions** - Defines strict boundaries with limited exceptions
  - **ALLOWED:** Read any file, write/edit files in docs/ directory only
  - **FORBIDDEN:** Modify source code, database schemas, config files, build files, tests
  - **EXCEPTIONS (APO-1 only):**
    - Fix hardcoded default values contradicting documented standards (e.g., `|| 4000` → `|| 3001`)
    - Update .env.example template values to match actual standards
    - ONLY simple constant/default changes (no logic modifications)
    - MUST verify against actual .env first
  - **Scenario C Example:** Docs show port 3001, .env has 3001, code default is 4000 → Fix code default to 3001

- **Trinity-docs-update - APO parallel execution system** - Phase 2 launches three documentation specialists concurrently
  - **APO-1:** Base documentation updates (architecture, setup, guides)
    - **NEW:** Configuration consistency fixes (simple defaults that contradict standards)
    - Update .env.example to match actual standards
    - Align configuration values across codebase and docs
    - Restriction: Only simple constants (no logic changes)
  - **APO-2:** Update existing business logic documentation OR new docs (first half)
  - **APO-3:** New business logic documentation (second half)
  - Each APO creates personal checklist from JUNO's audit report
  - All APOs verify changes against actual codebase (not assumptions)
  - Output: Updated/new documentation files in docs/

- **Trinity-docs-update - APO verification requirements** - Mandatory codebase verification for all documentation changes
  - **For EVERY change, APO must:**
    1. Identify what needs to change (from JUNO's assignment)
    2. Verify correct value in codebase (read .env, source files, config)
    3. Document verification in task (which files read, what found)
    4. Use Read tool BEFORE making changes
    5. Use Edit tool with verified information only
    6. DO NOT make assumptions or guesses
  - **Verification examples:**
    - API ports → Read .env, server.js, app.js
    - Table names → Read init.sql or check production database
    - Endpoint URLs → Read route files
    - Method signatures → Read actual source file
    - Configuration values → Read config files
  - **Documentation format:**
    ```markdown
    - [x] docs/api/README.md
      - Verification: Read backend/.env - confirmed port is 3001
      - Changes made: Updated 49 instances of port number to 3001
    ```

- **Trinity-docs-update - JUNO verification loop** - Phase 3 ensures 100% completion before final audit
  - **Step 3.1:** JUNO checks all three APO checklists for completion status
    - Counts total tasks vs completed tasks per APO
    - Calculates completion percentage
    - Determines next action (PROCEED or RESTART)
  - **Step 3.1A:** Re-launch incomplete APOs automatically
    - Identifies incomplete APOs from JUNO's report
    - Restarts only incomplete APOs with resume instructions
    - Loops until all APOs reach 100%
  - **Step 3.2:** JUNO final quality audit (only when all APOs 100% complete)
    - Verifies files created/updated
    - Checks content accuracy against codebase
    - Validates no hallucinated components
    - Generates verification report with pass/fail status
  - **Output:** `trinity/reports/DOCS-UPDATE-VERIFICATION-{{DATE}}.md`

- **Trinity-docs-update - Three template files** - Command template and two checklist templates deployed via CLI
  - **Command Template:** `src/templates/.claude/commands/maintenance/trinity-docs-update.md.template`
    - Deployed to: `.claude/commands/maintenance/trinity-docs-update.md`
    - Updated by: `trinity update` command via `updateCommands()` function
  - **JUNO Checklist:** `src/templates/trinity/templates/documentation/reports/juno-docs-update-checklist.md.template`
    - Deployed to: `trinity/templates/documentation/reports/juno-docs-update-checklist.md`
    - Updated by: `trinity update` command via `updateTemplates()` function (recursively copies all documentation templates)
  - **APO Checklist:** `src/templates/trinity/templates/documentation/reports/apo-docs-update-checklist.md.template`
    - Deployed to: `trinity/templates/documentation/reports/apo-docs-update-checklist.md`
    - Updated by: `trinity update` command via `updateTemplates()` function (recursively copies all documentation templates)
  - All templates automatically deployed during `trinity deploy` and updated during `trinity update`

- **Trinity-docs command - Complete architectural overhaul** - Transformed from single-agent to multi-agent orchestration
  - **New Architecture:** JUNO audit → 3 parallel APO instances → Verification
  - **JUNO Agent Integration:** Read-only codebase audit creates documentation checklist before generation
  - **Parallel APO Execution:** APO-1 (diagrams), APO-2 (guides/API), APO-3 (config) run concurrently
  - **Performance:** 3x faster execution via parallel agent orchestration
  - **Context Efficiency:** Each agent receives focused instructions (<100 lines) vs single 2,577-line spec

- **Trinity-docs command - External template system** - Created 28 reusable documentation templates
  - **Template Directory:** `trinity/templates/documentation/` with 8 categories
  - **Mermaid Diagrams (4 templates):** MVC flow, database ER, API endpoint map, component hierarchy
  - **Guides (4 templates):** Getting started, API development, deployment, contributing
  - **API Documentation (1 template):** API README with endpoint structure
  - **Configuration (2 templates):** Documentation structure, env-example generator
  - **Discovery (4 templates):** Framework detection, component discovery, API endpoint scanner, env variable extraction
  - **Validation (3 templates):** APO self-validation checklists for all 3 agents
  - **Processes (6 templates):** APO workflows (common, diagram-specific, guide-specific, config-specific), error handling, fallback mechanisms
  - **Reports (2 templates):** JUNO internal report, ROOT-README for template organization
  - **Template Variables:** All templates use `{{UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORE}}` syntax for dynamic content replacement

- **Trinity-docs command - Template validation phase** - Optional Phase 0.2 validates template syntax
  - Validates `{{VARIABLE}}` syntax (must be UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORE)
  - Detects nested variables (not supported)
